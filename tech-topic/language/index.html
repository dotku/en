      <h1>Programming Languages</h1>
      <p>We have hundred or thousand programming languages, but mostly common 
      used programming might be around 10~20. And not all programming language 
      are welcome in a company or in some certain project. The reason might be 
      simple as the manager just doesn't know too much about; and certainly, 
      each language has their own advantages and disadvantage.</p>
      <p>Here is my collection, and hopefully it would help some people to find
      the job or get into some certain company.</p>
      <table class="table">
        <tr>
          <th>Company<th>
          <th>Project</th>
          <th>Programming Languages</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Google</td>
          <td>Google Map</td>
          <td>Java, Python, Go</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Facebook</td>
          <td></td>

      <p>Also there are few programming language was very popular but right now, less developers are using it;
      which means you have less opportunity to find a job. Well, some of them could return, such as Ruby.
      It was a programming less known, since Rails' help, Ruby getting popular but right now... it is still less
      using programming language, and nobody knows when the miracle would come again.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Perl</li>
        <li>Ruby</li>
        <li>Basic</li>
        <li>Flash/Air</li>
        <li>Pascal</li>
        <li>Fortran</li>
        <li>Cobol</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I wonder why Ruby is now concidered as dead programming language in 20014 by dice, but... 
      well, I have a list for 2013 which is marked as popular programming language by dice.</p>
